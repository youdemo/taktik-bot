"""Device identity — a stable id for THIS machine, shared by every local writer.

One row, generated once, never updated. Electron runs an identical idempotent
migration (front/electron/database/migrations.ts), so whichever process opens the
database first creates the identity and the other reuses it.

Why it exists: the database syncs across several PCs (Turso) but rows historically
carried no trace of which device created them — sync maintenance had to guess
ownership from a created_at ≈ interaction_time heuristic. Rows stamped with
origin_device_id (scalar subquery at INSERT) make ownership exact.
