"""Blocking-modal recovery.

A mis-tap can open an UNEXPECTED sheet/dialog (the Direct share sheet sits right next to the
comment button) that silently BLOCKS a workflow: the bot keeps waiting for an element that will
never appear on the wrong screen. The WorkflowWatchdog is the time-based safety net (it recovers
after ~90s of no progress); this mixin is the cheap PROACTIVE counterpart the interaction engine
runs between action phases, so a stray modal is cleared immediately instead of stalling a profile.

Signatures live in `ui/selectors/support/blocking_modals.py` (single source of truth, shared with
the comment action and the watchdog).
