"""Per-target interaction plan — the resolved INTENT for one profile/account.

The seed of the platform-agnostic `InteractionPlan` model (see
`internal docs`): the engine turns a config + the
rolled interactions into a concrete, per-profile plan, separating the WHAT (how many likes,
which story slide to like) from the HOW (gestures/timing, handled by the humanization engine).

Three facts this fixes, all caught on real runs via the step telemetry:
- likes were never sampled in [min, max] — the loop always targeted max (≈ always 3);
- the like target ignored profile SIZE — 3 likes on a 10-post account (30% of the feed!)
  reads the same as 3 likes on a 500-post account; the count is now proportional to how
  many posts the profile has (a small account gets few likes, a large one can take more);
- story-like liked EVERY watched slide — a human leaves at most one like on a story.

Pure + dependency-free (only stdlib `random`/`math`) so it's unit-testable and reusable by
every workflow (Instagram now, TikTok later) and, in time, by the Taktik-Agent orchestrator.
