"""Persona Analysis — owner writing-style line extraction (pure, no device).

`owner_lines_from_comment_descs` keeps only the comment rows authored by the analyzed account
(its own voice), stripping the leading author handle from the row content-desc. This is the pure
core of the writing-style enrichment folded into persona analysis; on-device row reading + reply
expansion are validated separately on real dumps.
