"""Comment composer detection — the bot must not try to click the comment button when
the composer is already open (cross-language, version-drift tolerant).

Caught on a real Lab run (IG v410 FR): `comment.open_and_type` failed 0/8 because the
screen was already in the comments thread (composer present) — there is no comment button
to click there. The fix: detect the open composer and type directly.
