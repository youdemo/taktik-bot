"""End-of-list detection (followers/following lists).

Kevin's rule: a scroll that reveals no NEW username is NOT proof of the end of the list (a small
scroll, an overlap, or the list resumed after interacting with a profile legitimately shows no
session-new username). End-of-list must be detected ONLY when the list is genuinely stuck — the
exact same page repeated, or an empty screen. Running out of profiles worth interacting with is a
separate decision (`max_consecutive_known_usernames` in the workflow loop).

    The direct-followers loop works a visible page ONE follower at a time (process one -> break ->

    fed to the detector, the "same page N times" counter trips is_the_end() after 5 re-scans of a
    single page even though the scroll never actually got stuck. The fix notifies the detector ONLY
    once a page is exhausted, so re-scans of a page still being worked never reach it. This models
    that discipline: one notify per DISTINCT exhausted page keeps the list alive across many pages,
    exactly where the old every-iteration notify would have falsely ended it.
