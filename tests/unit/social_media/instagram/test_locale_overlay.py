"""Multi-language selector overlay (locales/) — Instagram profile pilot.

Locks the base + ``L()`` overlay behaviour:
- language-neutral resource-ids are ALWAYS present whatever the active locale;
- a known locale injects ONLY its own language fragments;
- the unknown locale falls back to the union of every language (= the legacy
  "keep-all" behaviour, so we never match fewer selectors than before);
- fields that historically had strings for one language only keep parity
  (no invented strings for the other language).

All assertions go through ``set_active_locale`` + the dataclass properties, which
is side-effect free (it never mutates the shared selector singletons), so tests
stay isolated. The destructive legacy in-place filter (``detect_and_optimize``
known-language path) is exercised by the Cartography Lab lot, not here.
